    <td class="content"><p>Facebook is a social networking website launched in February 2004
        that is operated and privately owned by Facebook, Inc., with more than
        500 million active users in July 2010, which is about one person for
        every fourteen in the world.[6][N 1] Users can add people as friends
        and send them messages, and update their personal profiles to notify
        friends about themselves. Additionally, users can join networks organized
        by workplace, school, or college. The website's name stems from the colloquial
        name of books given to students at the start of the academic year by
        university administrations in the US with the intention of helping students
        to get to know each other better. Facebook allows anyone who declares
        themselves to be aged 13 or older to become a member of the website.</p>
      <h4>How it got started</h4>
      <p>Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and
        fellow computer science students Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz and
        Chris Hughes.[7] The website's membership was initially limited by the
        founders to Harvard students, but was expanded to other colleges in the
        Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added
        support for students at various other universities before opening to
    high school students, and, finally, to anyone aged 13 and over.</p>
      <h4>What makes up Facebook</h4>
      <p>Facebook, the product, is made up of core site functions and applications.
      Fundamental features to the experience on Facebook are a person’s Home
      page and Profile. The Home page includes News Feed, a personalized feed
      of his or her friends updates. The Profile displays information about
      the individual he or she has chosen to share, including interests, education
      and work background and contact information. Facebook also includes core
      applications – Photos, Events, Videos, Groups, and Pages – that let people
      connect and share in rich and engaging ways. Additionally, people can
      communicate with one another through Chat, personal messages, Wall posts,
    Pokes, or Status Updates.</p>
