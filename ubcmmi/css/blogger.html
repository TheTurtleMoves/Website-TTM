    <td class="content"><p>Blogger is a blog publishing service that allows private or multi-user
        blogs with time-stamped entries. It was created by Pyra Labs, which was
        bought by Google in 2003. Generally, the blogs are hosted by Google at
        subdomains of blogspot.com. Up until May 1, 2010 Blogger allowed users
        to publish blogs on other hosts, via ftp. All such blogs had (or still
        have) to be moved to Google's own servers, with domains other than blogspot.com
        allowed via Custom URLs.</p>
      <h4>What is a Blog?</h4>
      <p>A blog (web log) is a personal diary. A daily pulpit. A collaborative
        space. A political soapbox. A breaking-news outlet. A collection of links.
        Your own private thoughts. Memos to the world. Your blog is whatever
        you want it to be. There are millions of them, in all shapes and sizes,
        and there are no real rules. In simple terms, a blog is a web site, where
        you write stuff on an ongoing basis. New stuff shows up at the top, so
        your visitors can read what's new. Then they comment on it or link to
      it or email you. Or not.</p>
      <h4>How the Company Got Started</h4>
      <p>Blogger was started by a tiny company in San Francisco called Pyra Labs
        in August of 1999. This was in the midst of the dot-com boom. They're
        a small (but slightly bigger than before) team in Google focusing on
        helping people have their own voice on the web and organizing the world's
    information from the personal perspective. </p>
